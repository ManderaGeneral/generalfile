It's relatively easily extended with any filetype by inheriting the File baseclass.

TODO: Try another approach for backup by using "x" mode and not copying

TODO: Add a time limit to our infinite loops, import Timer from generallibrary
TODO: Docstring and tests for rename

done
TODO: classfiletsv
TODO: Change suffix, "suffix" is apparently already used for filetype
TODO: Multiple dots are actually allowed
TODO: pip install flynt to convert format() to f strings
TODO: Remove File.getAbsolute(Path) to only use Path.getAbsolute() - Not Pythonic to have two ways to do same thing
